# **Project Description**

The goal of this project is to manage generic C++ code of Group'S . 

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing and organizing generic C++ code in HEP calculation. It is designed to simplify the calculation process, improve code maintainability, and enhance collaboration among students in Group'S. 

## Features

### 1. Code Organization

The project offers a structured approach to organizing C++ code. It provides a directory structure that separates different components of the program, such as **constants**, **anomalous dimension**, and **hard functions**. This organization system helps in locating and managing code files efficiently. Such as QCD Beta function:

$$
\beta(\alpha_{s})=-2\alpha_{s}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\beta_{n}\left(\frac{\alpha_{s}}{4\pi}\right)^{n+1},
$$

```
double Beta[4] = {(11 * CA) / 3. - (4 * nf * TF) / 3., (34 * pow(CA, 2)) / 3. - (20 * CA * nf * TF) / 3. - 4 * CF *nf *TF, (2857 * pow(CA, 3)) / 54. + ((-1415 * pow(CA, 2)) / 27. - (205 * CA * CF) / 9. + 2 * pow(CF, 2)) * nf *TF + ((158 * CA) / 27. + (44 * CF) / 9.) * pow(nf, 2) * pow(TF, 2), 149753 / 6. + (1093 * pow(nf, 3)) / 729. + 3564 * riemann_zeta(3) + pow(nf, 2) * (50065 / 162. + (6472 * riemann_zeta(3)) / 81.) - nf * (1078361 / 162. + (6508 * riemann_zeta(3)) / 27.)};

```



### 2. Build System

The project includes a reliable build system that automates the compilation and linking process. It supports various build configurations, allowing developers to build the code for different platforms and environments effortlessly.


### 3. Code Formatting and Style Guidelines

Consistency in coding style is crucial for readability and maintainability. The project enforces code formatting rules and adheres to widely accepted style guidelines, making the codebase consistent and easier to understand.

### 4. Dependency Management

Managing dependencies is simplified with the project's built-in dependency management system. It allows developers to specify the required libraries and versions, automatically resolving and fetching them, thus streamlining the development process.


## Conclusion

In summary, this project aims to streamline workflow, improve collaboration, and enhance the overall quality of their codebase.
